## Speaker equipment funding

This year's !!Con will be held entirely online!  For speakers that don't
already have an audio/video setup of broadcast quality, we offer financial
assistance as needed for camera and microphone equipment.

## Speaker honorarium

Preparing an amazing conference talk is hard work.  To show our
appreciation, we’re paying all our speakers a $256 (US) honorarium.

## Accessibility

!!Con is committed to being an conference available to everyone.  Your talk
will be captioned live by a professional stenographer.  If you need other
assistance in presenting at !!Con, please don’t hesitate to [let us
know](index.html#organizers) what we can do to make your speaking
arrangement comfortable.

## A note about time zones

Although !!Con has traditionally been a New York-based conference, we're
excited to change our format to be available to speakers -- and attendees --
no matter where they are!  Speakers will have the option of presenting
either a pre-recorded talk* or a live talk*, and although we can't guarantee
it yet, we additionally hope to have presentation slots that are accessible
to speakers on many different time zones.  If you've previously been
interested in speaking at a !!Con, but the requirement to travel has made
that otherwise impossible for you, we'd hope you'll consider submitting a
talk this year!
