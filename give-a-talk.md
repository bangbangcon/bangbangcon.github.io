# Call for talk proposals

Hi! !!Con is back for our **twelfth and final celebration** of the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing, and we want **you** to submit a talk* proposal. The **submission deadline** is **Tuesday, May 28th**. You can submit more than one proposal.

This will be the last !!Con, so if you have a talk you've always wanted to give, now's the time!

Since its launch in 2014, !!Con talks have featured everything from [glowing
mushrooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T75FvUDirNM) to [game
theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHg2JIvoaq0); from [machine
knitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihqcgrR0azw) to
[Pokémon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ-6UsYYe_Y); from [live
coding on an Apple II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY4t9IHFD4E) to
[queer feminist cyberpunk
manifestos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GiQovHaT_g).  We’ve had
speakers who are programmers, poets, scientists, students, and more!

What’s an idea that delights you? Did you learn something surprising recently? Is there a tool you love that you’ve been telling everyone about? Did you do something with computers that seems impossible or amazing or just really fun? Please take this call for talk proposals as an invitation to meditate on what you find exciting and surprising and delightful about programming and computing, and then submit a talk about one of those things!

The only requirements are that your talk*:

  * be computing-related!
  * be about something you think is interesting and cool!
  * **have at least one exclamation mark in the title!**

What do we mean by talk* with an asterisk? We [have an expansive definition of what
we consider](https://organicdonut.com/2019/01/expanding-the-con-aesthetic/) a "talk"
for !!Con’s 10-minute slots!  Send us plays about the joy of computing,
musical numbers about a bug you found, magic shows using strace.  Whatever
you want to do with a ten-minute slot, we’d love to hear about it.  Of
course, we’re looking forward to seeing good old-fashioned talk proposals as
well.

We would **especially** like to hear from you if:

  * you submitted a talk* proposal in the past that was rejected (we've had to reject **so many** talk proposals we loved).
  * you’ve never spoken at a tech conference. Some of our favorite !!Con talks have been from first-time speakers.
  * you find that people like you are underrepresented at programming conferences. We're committed to doing work to make !!Con a good experience for you. See our [code of conduct](conduct.html).

**All talks will be ten minutes long.** Ten minutes isn’t much time, so
think carefully about the scope of your talk* and be clear in the
[timeline](http://decomposition.al/blog/2017/06/30/how-to-write-a-timeline-for-a-bangbangcon-talk-proposal/)
about how you plan to spend the time.  A single, focused idea is best – go
for “here’s my favorite assembly instruction” rather than “here’s an
overview of how assembly works”.

Proposals will be [anonymized to avoid
bias](https://organicdonut.com/2018/03/the-con-talk-anonymization-and-selection-process/). 
Although we ask for your name, email address, and so on in the proposal
submission form, only one or two organizers who serve as anonymizers will
actually see this information, and they won’t review your proposal.  The
rest of the organizing team will review your proposal without knowing who
you are.

## Speaker travel funding

!!Con will be held at UC Santa Cruz, in Santa Cruz, CA, in an outdoor venue.  We offer financial assistance for travel expenses (stuff like flights, trains, lodging, and meals while traveling) for speakers traveling from outside of the Santa Cruz area. If you're not from the Santa Cruz area and you want to request funding, please fill out the relevant section of the [proposal submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyfoOhoqUYAecDT1F-wGwGlGvPgnCBHfo8tJkdUPsJkwdKZg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Because submissions are reviewed anonymously, requesting financial assistance will not affect a proposal's chances of acceptance.

We expect speakers to present in-person. However, if any accepted speaker anticipates difficulties (visa or health reasons, for example) in traveling to the conference, we will make arrangements to enable remote participation, and not require them to attend the conference in order to present their talk. In such a case [contact us](index.html#organizers) for further guidance.

## Speaker honorarium

Preparing an amazing conference talk is hard work.  To show our
appreciation, we’re paying all our speakers a $256 (USD) honorarium.

## Health Precautions and Virtual Attendance

We're committed to balancing the health of our attendees with the desire to gather in-person. To this end, we’re taking advantage of the mild and beautiful Santa Cruz summer weather to hold the conference **outdoors**, at the courtyard of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz!

Additionally, we will be creating a comprehensive COVID safety plan for the event. Stay tuned for the details, and feel free to [contact us](index.html#organizers) in the meantime.

While we expect that most talks will be in person, for speakers who cannot attend the conference in person, we would be happy to discuss possibilities for presenting your talk virtually!

## Accessibility

!!Con is committed to being an conference available to everyone.  Your talk
will be captioned live by a professional stenographer.  If you need other
assistance in presenting at !!Con, please don’t hesitate to [let us
know](index.html#organizers) what we can do to make your speaking
arrangement comfortable.

You can submit your talk* by [using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyfoOhoqUYAecDT1F-wGwGlGvPgnCBHfo8tJkdUPsJkwdKZg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Thanks for submitting to !!Con!
