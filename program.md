# Conference program

Jump directly to the [Saturday](#saturday) or [Sunday](#sunday) program!

Coffee, tea, water, and pastries/bagels breakfast will be available both days.  **We will not be serving lunch.**  Instead, we have a 90-minute lunch break each day, so you have time to go out and try some of the myriad food options in the neighborhood (or bring food and enjoy it at our venue).
