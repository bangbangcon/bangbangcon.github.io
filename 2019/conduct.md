# Code of conduct

Our goal with !!Con is to bring the NYC programming community together
for a conference about the excitement, joy, and surprise of
programming.

We value the participation of each member of the community and want
all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling
experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect
and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all
conference events, whether officially sponsored by !!Con or not.

All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any
!!Con event are required to observe the following Code of
Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

**Why have a code of conduct?** Not because we feel like we're
expected to have one; not because someone told us to; not because we
heard somewhere that it was important for some reason -- but **as part
of an intentional effort to define the culture of !!Con**.

## The short version

!!Con is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or
anything else. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for !!Con.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference
at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## The longer version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
derisive comments regarding technical background, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist,
and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around
you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for
!!Con.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates the anti-harassment
policy, the conference organizers may take any action they deem
appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
conference.

## Social rules

In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy,
we have a small set of
[social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) we
follow. We (the organizers) learned and lifted these rules from
[the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where we felt that
they contributed enormously to a supportive, productive, and fun
learning environment. We'd like !!Con to share that environment. These
rules are intended to be lightweight, and to make more explicit
certain social norms that are normally implicit. Most of our social
rules really boil down to "don't be a jerk" or "don't be annoying." Of
course, almost nobody sets out to be a jerk or annoying, so telling
people not to be jerks isn't a very productive strategy.

Unlike the anti-harassment policy, violation of the social rules will
not result in expulsion from the conference or a strong warning from
conference organizers.  Rather, they are designed to provide some
lightweight social structure for conference attendees to use when
interacting with each other.

If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or
social rules, please feel free to reach out to any of the conference
organizers.
