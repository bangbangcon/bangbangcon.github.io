### Bruce Waggoner - Saving Voyager 1!

Both of the 47 year old Voyager spacecraft are currently in interstellar space and returning their most important data set; in-situ measurements of the magnetic field, plasma and dust beyond the Heliopause.   In late 2023, Voyager 1 lost all downlink telemetry and the flight team had essentially no visibility into the state of the spacecraft which is over 15 billion miles from the Earth.   This talk will detail how the flight team diagnosed the problem, and formulated a recovery plan to patch the Flight Data System flight software.

I am the Mission Assurance Manager at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab/Caltech. I graduated from the University of Nebraska with a BS in Physics and Astronomy.  I have worked at JPL for 39 years supporting dozens of Earth orbiting and deep space missions.  I also volunteer as a gymnastics coach and assist teaching girls engineering and science at a local high school.

**It's alive.... IT'S ALIVE!!! Braitenberg Vehicles! (Have you ever seen an AI like this??!!)**

"AI has been getting more and more complex. Surrounded by chess robots, self-driving cars, and now Large Language Models, we begin to ask ourselves: what does it take for a machine to behave like a human? Does it take millions of parameters? Mountains of training data?

None of the above! Introducing... Braitenberg Vehicles! These are simple, human-like robots that are made only of a couple of sensors and motors. In this talk, I will convince you that these simple components are enough to show human-like behavior, and we will get to see some Braitenberg Vehicles in action using a Braitenberg Vehicles Simulator I made!"

**Devon** is a student at Harvey Mudd College studying computer science and mathematics. Outside of computer science, they also like to write musical theater!

**Making Chinese Typefaces! with Components!!??!!**

Are you stuck finding a great chinese typeface for you to use? Scared to find something that might get twitter in a fight over? This talk will teach you the basics of Chinese type systems, how to use them, and why computing and component based architecture can dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for you to make an 8,000 character font.

**Ivan Zhao** (he/him) is a poet, game & type designer, and web artist interested in nonlinear narratives, forms, and mechanics that reckon with digital, diasporic, and queer identity. His work interrogates individual and viewer agency.

**The Astrolabe! Using modern digital computing to recreate ancient analog computers**

For fifteen hundred years, the astrolabe was the most widely-used computing device on earth, sometimes called ‚Äúthe original smartphone‚Äù. They were traditionally made by hand, but I had to find out: how hard would it be to design and make one using only digital design and computer-controlled fabrication methods?

**Jes Wolfe** is a software developer and payments engineer in Portland Oregon, whose code has almost certainly handled some of your money at some point. They spend their free time misusing technology, doing space math for astrologers, and helping their six-year-old invent new integer sequences.

**Calculating the Ideal "Sex and the City" Polycule!**

Sex and the City, the iconic early 2000s show, depicted social life, sex, and relationships through a lens rarely seen at that time that shook society to its core. But this cultural phenomenon had one fatal flaw: it was based on the assumption that each protagonist could only end up with *one* person. I couldn't help but wonder... what if each person could be in an ethically and consenting relationship with more than one person at a time? What would the ideal polycule be? How do we even calculate that? What would the math look like? These are the questions society needs to be asking! These are the real problems VCs should be investing in! Dare I say, if we put a man on the moon we can settle once and for all who Carrie *actually* should have ended up with. It's time to disrupt polyamory.

**Pablo** is a full stack engineer, specializing in building software for humanitarian emergencies. In his spare time he enjoys contemplating hypothetical endings to TV shows and working out the answers to questions that should have never been asked.

**Backtraces in the Mirror: Stealing the Secrets of Elves and Dwarves to Perform Mad Science!!**

While writing an unobtrusive memory profiler, I discovered I needed to reconstruct a running program's stack the wrong way around! I thought this was impossible, and it turns out I was wrong! So join me to learn about how stack unwinding works (and when it doesn't!), how to use ELF and DWARF information all wrong(!), working with uncertain information (and why!), and the value of doing things that "can't possibly work"!!

**Julian Squires** is a lifelong programmer and eccentric layabout. He previously spoke at !!Con 2017 about "the Emoji that Killed Chrome" (!!).

**Riveting Insights! Bridge.watch and the State of America's Infrastructure**

There are over 600,000 bridges in the U.S. with nearly 4 billion daily crossings. While the (fortunately rare) bridge collapse will make national news, what other publicly available information is there that we can dig into the state of U.S. infrastructure? This talk will go over the development of an open source application, [project name], for processing, cleaning, and visualizing bridge infrastructure data from the FHWA and what insights can be gained through simple queries and generating different visuals on the fly.

**Maryanne Wachter** is a software developer and professional engineer. As a structural engineer, she's worked on landmark transit projects, long-span bridges, and various educational/cultural centers in the U.S. and Europe. She currently works as a senior software engineer at Ready.net specializing in geospatial data visualization.

**It wasn‚Äôt me, it was the cosmic rays! Blaming physics for our evil actions!**

As we know from Murphy, everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Sometimes, a single particle close to your computer's memory will turn a 0 into 1 or vice-versa. There exist lots of examples of real-life bugs caused by this effect. Since bit-flips do occur in our devices, this means nobody can blame us if suddenly a single bit from an executable file changes! It could've been a random cosmic ray that caused the damage! In this talk, we can see how this plausible deniability comes handy to attackers: they might create sophisticated supply-chain attacks or gain persistent access to systems, just with a single bit-flip that can be explained by a physical phenomenon!

**Mat√≠as** is an Argentinian security researcher and developer. He believes someday engineers will have the right tools and knowledge to build truly secure software. Since that hasn't occurred yet, he refuses to use many applications until their security holes get fixed.

**Programming with only exceptions!**

We're used to programming with a lot of control flow constructs, but some languages (üëÄ Python...) use exceptions for control flow. What if that was *all* we had? Nicole made the poor decision to find out, and created Hurl! She will discuss what programming looks like when we eschew normal control flow, how to implement normal-feeling control flow, and some of the limitations of the existing Hurl implementation.

**Nicole** is a Principal Software Engineer at Remesh, where she focuses on software architecture, performance, scalability, and security. Outside of work, she plays with her kids, spends too much time on computers, hangs out at the Recurse Center, and drinks tons of decaf coffee.

**88 Files a Second - Running Flappy Bird inside MacOS Finder!**

MacOS's Finder is designed for browsing files - but it's powerful enough to run Flappy Bird. Kind of. In this talk I'll cover how to get Flappy Bird running at 4 frames (and 88 files) a second in Finder - complete with a full game loop, high score tracking, and marquee banner ads. I'll start with a barely sub-1-frame-a-second prototype and walk you through the hacks I needed to productionize the game, such as: 

* Simulating a "button" inside the filesystem via a Finder-specific "last opened" timestamp 
* Symlinking 44 files to their parent directories 
* Stuffing emojis into filenames 
* Implementing double buffering inside a Finder window via bizarre AppleScript incantations 

You'll hopefully leave with a newfound appreciation for the power of Finder and AppleScript and a better understanding of why double buffering is important for a smooth gaming experience.

**Nolen Royalty** loves embedding games in surprising places and building experiences that connect strangers over the internet - you can find his work at https://eieio.games.

### Omar Rizwan

**How to make your own microchip!!!**

<a name="omar-rizwan" id="omar-rizwan"></a>
<img src="images/speakers/omar-rizwan.png" alt="Omar Rizwan" class="speaker-img" />

Have you ever looked at your phone or laptop and wondered how it's made? The answer is that almost all of the 'technology' in it -- CPU, GPU, screen, camera, power electronics, motion sensor, radio -- is microchips that have been either drawn or coded up in the language Verilog, then manufactured in chip fabs. A few years ago, I took a class where I designed my own chip and got it fabricated (the resulting chips are sitting on my desk here). I'll talk about that process, how you write code to produce a chip, and how that chip actually looks up close, including how it physically looks in my hand, the 2D planar view, and a 3D view that we can fly around!

**Omar** works on new ways to program and interact with computers. He made TabFS, a browser extension that turns your browser tabs into virtual files; Screenotate, an augmented screenshot app; and he's worked on physical computing systems at Dynamicland and Folk Computer.

**Huggable Data! Making the Ephemeral Last Longer with Textile Dataviz!**

<a name="quinn-dombrowski" id="quinn-dombrowski"></a>
<img src="images/speakers/quinn-dombrowski.png" alt="Quinn Dombrowski" class="speaker-img" />

Computers and data are closely intertwined: we use computers to capture and create and analyze data, and often to generate visualizations of that data. The things we enjoy -- and hate -- doing on computers are backed by data files. It's difficult to imagine computers without data, and data without the context of the modern computer. Yet, humans have been keeping track of data (or at least, information that could be transformed into data) for millennia prior to the invention of the computer. As fragile as these historical materials can be, they are in most cases easier to preserve than our computer-generated data. Maintaining digital data takes a great deal of time, attention, care, and resources -- and most of us aren't doing it for the data we care about. For some kinds of textual data (e.g. favorite pieces of fanfic, important emails) printing it out is a reasonable approach, but printing out large tabular data sets can maintain the fidelity of individual values, but this is unwieldy to the point of unusability. It renders inaccessible, in many cases, what makes a data set interesting. Enter textile data visualization: transforming data into a medium with a longer probable lifespan than bits. Moreover, a textile can be hung on a wall, it can be worn (to pieces), it can be cuddled with, it can be passed down across generations. Building on the earlier !!Con talk on machine knitting, this talk will draw together examples of textile data visualization -- with different kinds of data (biology, sci-fi novels, insomnia, dating app chat logs), and different textile media (digital knitting machines, weaving, embroidery, and sewing). Some visually reproduce the kinds of visualizations that computers create; others translate the data into the affordances (e.g. stitch / stitch length, warp and weft) of the textile medium. This talk will celebrate the intersection of computing, data, and textile craft, and argue that the data dearest to us deserves to live as more than bits.

**Quinn Dombrowski** founded and runs the Textile Makerspace at Stanford University. In addition to textiles, Quinn supports humanities scholars using technology for their research, with projects including the Data-Sitters Club.

### Rebecca Ravenoak

**Algorithmically Generated Flower Beds!! (inspired by Ancient & Modern Polychrome Textiles)**

<a name="rebecca-ravenoak" id="rebecca-ravenoak"></a>
<img src="images/speakers/rebecca-ravenoak.png" alt="Rebecca Ravenoak" class="speaker-img" />

Polychrome textiles are created by overlapping and interlacing two or more colors of thread in a way that creates areas of solid and blended colors. This talk is about using that same technique (digitally) to create flowerbed textures based on a fabric structure called Crackle or J√§mtlandsdr√§ll, but this is not a technical weaving talk. It‚Äôs about creating colorful patterns that can be used in pixel art based on algorithmically generated tiles and patterns..

**Rebecca** is a computer programmer and artist who works with digital and physical textiles. They weave, code, bake, and garden just south of Oakland in a wacky old house full of cats and as many weird little succulents as they can grow.

### Taylor Troesh

**bang! bang! he murdered math! {the musical!}**

<a name="taylor-troesh" id="taylor-troesh"></a>
<img src="images/speakers/taylor-troesh.png" alt="Taylor Troesh" class="speaker-img" />

In 1931, a lone man murdered math with two shots from a recursive revolver. The two incompleteness theorems punctured permanent holes in our once-pristine mathematical paradise. To this day, landmines lie lurking in the logical landscape. Who will protect our precious computers from inconsistency itself? A $1,000,000 bounty awaits the hero who thwarts the ghost of gunslingin' G√∂del! Join us by the computational campfire for a bluegrass ballad!

**Taylor** is mayor of taylor.town and certified connoisseur of crap. He tinkers with writing, learning, time, design, software, ideas, and humor.

**SATisfying Answers to Difficult Questions!**

SAT solvers have been used to find solutions to a wide variety of problems in domains such as code generation, formal verification, and scheduling. But what even are they, and how do they work?? In this talk I'll provide a brief overview of what a SAT solver is and some different approaches they use to solve problems! I hope to demystify these very useful tools and give you some insight into why and when you might want to use them.

**Vaibhav** used to write web applications for a living. He still does, but he used to, too. When he's not doing that you can find him at the gym making sure the weight trees have equal numbers of plates on them or engaging in some ill-advised revenge bedtime procrastination.

**Let‚Äôs find random things on the street with full-text search!**

Imagine being able to find every ‚Äúbest pizza‚Äù shop sign, every "No Parking" notice, or every piece of street art in Brooklyn - without leaving your chair. In this talk, Yufeng will unveil "all texts in Brooklyn" (https://brooklyn.textual.city/), a project that turns Google Street View into a searchable text database. Yufeng will walk through the process of building this full-text search engine, demonstrate interesting search results, and showcase data visualizations that reveal hidden patterns in Brooklyn's urban typography.

**Yufeng Zhao** is an artist, technologist and designer based in Brooklyn. His work addresses data, imagery/language processing, and experience design. Through a blend of web-based projects, video works, and tangible installations, his practice explores unexpected connections embedded in our techno-cultural landscape and the interactions between humans and machines. He is a part of the Switcheristic Telecommunications (swtch.tel), an artist collective focusing on assembling and presenting atypical data.
