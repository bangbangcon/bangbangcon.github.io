**Taperipper or, Oops! All SCSI!**

One catgirls venture from a neat idea down the rabbit hole of a not-so legacy protocol, learning more than she bargained for, all in the quest for a joke.

**Aki** is a low-level developer with a primary focus on C++ but she is interested in the whole stack, from software to silicon and does hardware design and electrical engineering in her free time.

**La-La-Lambda Calculus: A Functional Musical Journey!**

The lambda calculus is a logical formalism that lets us represent programs - all their logic and data - as nothing but pure, anonymous, single-parameter functions.  Numbers, operators, booleans, control flow, data structures… any way you want it, lambda functions can do it! In this musical talk we’ll sing the praises of the lambda as we take a quirky, nerdy journey toward a deeper understanding & admiration of the computational power of this elegant, powerful abstraction at the heart of functional programming.

**Anjana** suffers from a chronic case of curiosity, which led her from philosophy to English teaching to computational linguistics to software development. As an engineer & educator, these days she mostly codes & teaches from her home base in San Francisco, when not traveling (in a mask) to events around the world to speak about the joy of programming and advocate for a more equitable & ethical tech industry. Nerd out with her about functional programming & JavaScript, ask her about the Recurse Center & Outreachy, and definitely invite her to your karaoke party!

**Code readability isn’t just about personal preference!**

Accessibility for developers isn’t often mentioned when we talk about writing code. Code style is one accessibility topic that is unfortunately mischaracterized as personal preference most of the time. Let’s prove that wrong and talk about the accessibility accommodations nearly all developers use every time they code.

**Ashlee** is a Disabled and Neurodivergent software engineer and web accessibility expert. She loves to knit, read, write, and spend time with her family of 2 rescued pitbulls (Trooper and Tango) and life partner (Zach). She has worked with React for several years, and currently works with Next.js as a Web Engineer at HashiCorp. Since October of 2021, she has been a member of the team building HashiCorp Developer. Her primary focus is building accessible and performant user interfaces. At a team level, she also works to establish and maintain accessible experiences for engineers. As a firm believer of "progress over perfection", she strives to make learning about accessibility easier for everyone.

### Omar Rizwan

**How to look for one image inside another image, fast!**

You know about regular expressions and string matching? Well, what about image matching? How would you look for images inside other images? One way that you might do it is to loop through each position in image A and at each of those positions, check how much the area around it looks like image B, so you can build a 'heat map' of which regions of image A look like image B. But that's really slow if image B is more than a few pixels big, since you need to do (number of pixels in A) * (number of pixels in B) iterations...

I was trying to do this for a new project/interface experiment -- a daemon that continuously watches your screen for image patterns that you tell it to look for -- and I found out that this task is called *template matching*, and you can do it way faster. The OpenCV library can do this all in tens of milliseconds, as opposed to the several seconds that the nested-loop approach took for me. So I wanted to know how OpenCV does it, and how I could get rid of the dependency and do it myself!

We'll talk about Apple's Accelerate library, convolution, the Fourier transform, summed-area tables, and why you need to use doubles sometimes instead of floats, among other things. In the end, I got to make the same jump, from seconds down to milliseconds (arguably, I'm even faster than OpenCV now, at least for what i want to do!) -- and the whole thing is basically one self-contained C file.

**Omar** is interested in new ways to interact with (and program) computers. He previously worked as a researcher at Dynamicland; he's also the creator of TabFS, Screenotate, Breakout-in-a-PDF, and a variety of other strange computer projects.
