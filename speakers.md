**_"Finding Friends in High Dimensions: Locality Sensitive Hashing For Fun and Friendliness!"_**

When you live in the big city, finding everyone's nearest neighbours takes a long time! Our judicious city planners have conjured a technique using randomness, hyperplanes, buckets, lexical sorting, and binary numbers to get the job done approximately and fast. Really fast. They call it Locality Sensitive Hashing and management loves the idea. But it sounds too good to be true!
 
 In this talk we'll explore Locality Sensitive Hashing, a technique to turn the computationally expensive Exact Nearest Neighbor Search problem into an inexpensive approximate solution (it's a neat trick and I promise you'll love it). We'll see how Locality Sensitive Hashing is used in Image Search, Recommendations, and other machine learning problems. And of course, we'll mention [Deep Hashing](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/L2H.html#deep-hashing), because why not?

**Aaron Levin** is a mathematician who fell in love with programming and now manages Data Science teams at SoundCloud. Aaron found a rare record once and wrote about it on [Weird Canada](https://weirdcanada.com).

**_"It's super effective! Solving Pokemon Blue with a single, huge regular expression"_**

I was playing my old copy of Pokemon Blue for the original Game Boy one day during winter holidays, for old times' sake. About an hour in, I realized that this was probably going to take me on the order of 20-30 hours to complete.
 
 20-30 hours! Who has time for that?
 
 What I'd really like to do is sit down, think very carefully, and write down all the moves I'd like to make, all at once, and then pass them to a regular expression, which will accept if (and only if) those moves will win a game of Pokemon Blue. This approach has a lot of advantages! For example, in addition to being faster to specify a complete moveset for a game, it allows you to put your entire game of Pokemon Blue game into a version control system (e.g., git), which allows you to apply the "infrastructure as code" philosophy to your Pokemon Blue runthrough.

**Alex Clemmer** is a computer programmer. Other programmers love Alex, excitedly describing him as 'employed here' and 'the boss's son'.

**_"Glk! A universal user interface! for interactive fiction!"_**

In 1997, I set out to extend Infocom's Z-machine to support modern interactive fiction. Surprisingly, many of my design decisions turned out to be clever! Glk is now a thriving software ecosystem which supports many IF platforms, interpreters, and other tools. It's also hard to pronounce Glk.
 
 Hear a twenty-year tale of interpreter support! Discover how my C API evolved into a Javascript API and a JSON data format while still being hard to pronounce! Marvel at how my attempt at a universal user interface was an inevitable failure, but still lets us do some really cool things! Wonder when I will get around to shipping Glk 2.0!

**Andrew Plotkin** has been working on interactive fiction and stuff like that for a very long time. He works as an indie game developer in Boston and helps run an IF meetup, an IF nonprofit, and occasionally things that are not directly related to IF. He also bakes cookies.

This is the story of the software and electronics behind [ANON: prokect], an interactive art project comprised of five huge, kinetic, glowing origami mushrooms. [ANON: project] was presented at [ANON: large festival] and at the [ANON: other large festival]. I'll share what I learned about using Raspberry Pi, Pixelpushers, and Node.js (yes, Javascript!) to control these large contraptions.

**Bomani McClendon** is a software engineer and designer from Nashville, currently studying Computer Science at Northwestern. He is passionate about learning sciences, music, and memorable digital experiences.

**_"Serious programming with jq?! A practical and purely functional programming language!"_**

Ever heard of jq? If so, chances are you've used it to format and syntax-highlight your json. You might have even used something like `jq '.foos[]'` to print each foo! But did you know jq has user-defined functions? That jq has modules? Get ready to take a dive into the wondrous and purely functional land of the jq programming language!

**Charles** is a 20-year-old undergrad. He spend the last year at Uber, and is now working on a math major at UChicago. He likes writing compilers while drinking probably too much tea.

**_Writing NES games! with assembly!!_**

Assembly language doesn't have to be that cryptic old language that nobody uses anymore.
 
 I'd like to take you on a stroll down memory lane and dig into the internals of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to figure out how it works.
 
 While we're there, let's see how you too can build a game for the NES using 6502 assembly with the help of a few modern tools.
 
 But why?! Because it's fun and you might learn a thing or two doing so. If anything you will have a new found respect for 80s developers and an appreciation for the high-level languages we have today.

**Christian** is a self-thought developer based in Montreal. At a young age he discovered Visual Basic 6 on his home computer and instantly fell in love with programming. When he is not reading about technology and programming, you may find him rock climbing, cooking or drinking a stout.

**_"Om! Nom! Nash!"_**

Om Nom Nom is a game about cute forest creatures eating each other. We can (almost) solve it by doing some game theory, and some tree search, with some cleverness. We won't always win, but nobody will be able to do better. We'll explore a few techniques for writing game solvers, and show how these techniques can be used to build an On Nom Nom solver. Then we never have to play it again!

**David Turner** hacks on git at Two Sigma. He previously co-founded OpenTripPlanner, and worked on version 3 of the GPL. He enjoys contributing patches to random projects, like Inkscape and Linux. He lives on Mars with his glorious wife and three pet tigers.  He spoke at !!Con in 2014.

**_"Corruption in the Data Center! TCP can fail to keep your data safe!"_**

TCP has a checksum and Ethernet has a CRC, both of which detect corrupt data. The math says this should make it extremely unlikely for applications talking to each other inside a data center to receive corrupt data. Unfortunately, it still happens. When it happened at Twitter it took a team of a few dozens people and multiple days to clean up the mess.
 
I'll talk about how we discovered that our applications were receiving corrupt data, and what we did to stop the bleeding. Then I'll walk though a high level overview of TCP, Ethernet, and switches to show how corruption can sneak past the CRC and checksum defenses. Finally, I'll describe how you can protect your applications by adding a strong CRC or using encryption.

**Evan** is a software engineer at Bluecore in New York, but was at Twitter at the time of this particular incident. He gets obsessed with technical problems that he doesn't understand, and writes about them [on his web site](http://www.evanjones.ca) so he never has to think about them again.

**_"Why So Loud! Geeking Out On Airline Data, Physics And Mapping."_**

We were looking for a new place to live in [ANON: european country]. I found myself eerily familiar with our preferred town because it's on the local airport approach path.
 
 What followed was a nerd montage of tracking flight paths by API, researching jet noise propagation effects, plotting heatmaps and making family relocation plans.
 
 This talk is that story.



**Ewan** is a career geek/autodidact with some pretty varied experience (scientific visualisation, games, app security, cloud infra) who has been remiss in the extreme about giving back to the community that spawned him. **Ewan**'s mission now is to share all the interesting tech ideas he can; to engage, entertain, encourage, support and wherever possible to engender the same ooh-howz-that-thing-work inquisitiveness he feels every day.

**_"ENHANCE! Upscaling images with neural networks"_**

When characters on a TV show “enhance!” a blurry image, you probably laugh and tell your friends that it’s impossible to do that in real life. But over the past year, deep learning research has actually made this kind of possible! How will you explain this to your friends!?

 In this talk, you’ll get an intuitive introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks, a new machine learning technique that’s surprisingly good at upscaling images. You’ll learn how these systems are inspired by human art forgers, and how you can use them to do other things like transform a horse into a zebra, convert a sentence into a photo, and so much more!

**Geoffrey** builds software for public schools at Panorama Education. He enjoys learning about machine learning and playing the cello, and occassionally posts on his [blog](http://geoffreylitt.com/).

**_"What alien invaders, birds, and computer simulations have in common: flocking!!"_**

Real flocks aren't what they're like in the movies.
 You've probably seen flocking behavior in The Avengers, the latest Star Trek movie, or even in The Ender's Game books. Flocks are groups of individuals, usually birds (or invading aliens when it comes to Sci-Fi), that are collectively moving together. The flocks in movies show individuals forming complex patterns, but they're all easily taken down by targeting a centralized point of command. In reality, flocking behavior is a lot simpler and there doesn't need to be any coordination between individuals--that means your favorite protagonists probably wouldn't have won when they came up against flocks!

**Jan** is an editor at No Starch Press and freelance Japanese to English translator. Sometimes she programs, usually with turtles.

**_"I wrote a polite email to a dead address in a PDF on the wayback machine and now I know where all the airplanes are!!!"_**

I spent a chunk of 2016 making a web application for myself and other nervous air passengers called [ANON: redacted name of product]. You can plug an upcoming flight into it and it tells you when you can expect to hit turbulence and how bad it'll be. Still kinda scary, but at least it'll surprise you less.
 
 I wanna tell you about how I made it, because I had to exercise my skills at social engineering — the good kind! — at least as much as software engineering. [ANON: redacted name of product] came about through finding in myself an uncharacteristic willingness to approach complete strangers, asking them politely for access to tools or data, and feeling surprised at how well it worked, time and again.

**Jason McIntosh** is a freelance software engineer, game-design consultant, and writer. He lives variously in and around New England. His homepage is at jmac.org, and he blogs regularly at fogknife.com.

**_"The TOP 5 Queer Feminist Cyberpunk Manifestos!"_**

“Our lot is cast with technoscience, where nothing is so sacred that it cannot be reengineered and transformed so as to widen our aperture of freedom, extending to gender and the human. To say that nothing is sacred, that nothing is transcendent or protected from the will to know, to tinker and to hack, is to say that nothing is supernatural.” 
 - Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation (Laboria Cuboniks)
 
 Who were the cyberfeminists? Why has practically no one heard of them? And what might it look like to hack your gender?
 
 For answers to these questions and more, join us on a whirlwind tour of the hidden history of cyberfeminisms, catalogued through the DIY manifesto form. We’ll rank the best of the best, adapting this rich intellectual legacy to reconcile our own relationships to computing tools (our phones, our laptops, our bodies) in the emergent techno-dystopia of the present.
 
 Remember: the first computers were women. Why shouldn’t the last women be computers?

I like finding ways to use technology for things that it wasn't originally meant to do. In this talk, I'll take you on a tour of a rabbit hole I followed recently: Using a web browser's 3D graphics capabilities to generate 2D video, and then converting the data in that video into sound, to produce music.

**_"What the heck time is it?!?"_**

To set your computer's clock just set it to match an atomic clock on the internet. Oh wait, don't forget to account for the time the request takes. Oh wait, and for the time the response takes. Oh and that request and response times might be different. Oh and that if you need to set your clock back your logs and transactions will be out of order (hello bank transfer hacks!). Oh and this needs to work for several billion devices on the internet doing this all day every day forever. Oh and if you do it wrong Very Bad Things Can Happen (bricked iPhones! broken TLS!)
 
We'll talk about how Network Time Protocol (NTP) sets your clock to the correct time despite the laws of physics making that impossible to do and human nature making it dangerous to even try.

**Joel** is a developer, cyclist, and maker in Brooklyn and he knows what a cliché he sounds like but he's okay with that. He spends his days building things at [Postlight Studios](https://postlight.com/).

One day, I came back from lunch to discover everyone's copy of Chrome wouldn't stop crashing!! How could turning on a printer downstairs cause an office-wide browser outage!?! A glorious part of programming is when a bug reveals the delicate fragility of a system far beyond its scope! Tracing down the culprit will take us through Unicode, mDNS, gdb, tcpdump, tcpreplay, and Objective-C!!

**_"HDR photography in Microsoft Excel?!"_**

Have you ever taken a photo with areas that are too bright or too
dark? As any photographer will tell you, high dynamic range
photography is the right way to solve your problem. And, as any
businessperson will tell you, Microsoft Excel is the right platform to
implement your solution.

In this talk, I'll explain the algorithm from one of the foundational
papers about HDR imaging --- no prior image processing knowledge
required. Turns out, it's just a system of linear equations! So,
obviously, the next step is to implement HDR in a spreadsheet. Because
we can. The end result reveals how this complicated-sounding algorithm
boils down to a few simple ideas.

**_"Where Are All the Space Robots?"_**

Earthlings are currently communicating with 33 space probes that have escaped Earth's orbit and set off into our solar system and beyond. Each mission's origins span borders and countries all over the world and conduct a wide variety of science, but getting information about these probes can be tricky. Several space agencies detail their own missions to varying degrees around the web, but outside of Wikipedia there was not a single website that described all the current active robots humans have flung into space, so we decided to build it! We wanted to create a website that was both beautiful to use and provided up to the minute information about Earth's robotic ambassadors. I'll demo the site, talk about the technology we used to produce it, and show how we use some python tools and an undocumented online data feed from NASA's Deep Space Network to display some up to the minute information about each probe.

**Lisa** is a planetary science web developer at the SETI Institute, the CTO of Spacehack.org, and an appointed NASA Datanaut. She loves creating beautiful user experiences through close collaborations with designers, and is on a mission to make space mission data more accessible.

**_"We Built a Game…for CHARITY!!"_**

In October 2016, I attended “Gift the Code”, a charity hackathon in Toronto. Our team built “PiKit”, a game designed for kids who lack fine motor control or who have limited mobility. The challenge was to build a fun, compelling, and educational game in which the only input was… a GIANT RED BUTTON! The game is now being played by kids at [ANON: a children's hospital].
 
 This talk is a beginner’s guide to designing and building a game, based on what I learned as a first-time game developer at the hackathon. I’ll talk about using constraints to spur creativity in a design sprint, how to get inspiration from your favourite games, and how to design a game with logical level progressions.

**Mahtab**'s dream job is to be a star on Broadway, but in the meantime works as a Senior Software Engineer at Capital One in Toronto, Canada.

**_"Automatic classification of quilt block patterns"_**

To make a quilt, you take a lot of small patches of fabric and sew them together into larger patterns called blocks. Long ago I had the computer generate every representative of a certain set of blocks, because I suspected that there would be some cool blocks in the set that were rarely seen. I was right! The set looks super cool.
 
 Some of the blocks were very easy to tell apart, but the differences between others were very subtle. I wondered if there was a way to get the computer to classify the blocks into families where the blocks in each family looked similar.
 
 This is a very nebulous problem, underspecified and vague. Just the kind of problem I like! The first thing I tried didn't work, but the second thing did, and I will explain how it works, with many cool illustrations, and explain some of the general problem-solving techniques that I use to solve vague and poorly-specified problems like this one.

**Mark Dominus** is married to a quilter.  He first became interested in programming in the mid-1970s from watching his mom do it.

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP to its friends) is the magic by which your laptop knows how to get to Twitter on a brand new network about which it knows nothing. DHCP can tell your computer what its address should be, and where it should go to connect out to other networks. It can also tell your laptop weird stuff, like that it should run all the traffic through a proxy!!

**_"Simulated Gravity Comes from Within!!"_**

The massively-multiplayer game Eve Online slows down the in-game clock when there are too many players in a region. That way, the network has enough time to process all those players.
 
 So here's a question: What if you slowed down the clock -- not in regions, but variably throughout the entire game, as one big region? Wouldn't that screw with your physics engine? I got curious, so I wrote a simulation with this time dilation added and... well, objects started orbiting each other!! The weird thing? I didn't include gravity in my program.

<img src="images/speakers/richard-harrington/apple2prompt.gif" width="35px" />

What’s the first thing you see when you turn on your computer? Back in the day (1983 or thereabouts) on the Apple II+/e/c, it was a command prompt and a blinking cursor! You had no choice but to start programming, and it was easy because it was BASIC! You could even drop down to an assembly language prompt and start poking around and entering instructions in the idiom of the 6502 processor itself! We’ll write a short animation program in BASIC, a subroutine in 6502 assembly, and call the latter from the former, all with no software installed but the ROM that came with the computer! (Speaker’s actual Apple IIc from childhood used in talk!)

**Richard Harrington** started programming in 1980, ran away from it for the theater in 1984 at the age of 15, then returned to his first love 25 years later, after touring the world with (among other things) a clown show called Motel California: the heartwarming tale of a ruthless Belgian mercenary who gives up his life of killing for the cabaret.

**_"Interpolation Search Can Be Fast, in Some Situations, Sometimes, If You Try"_**

When was the last time you binary searched a phone book? Never? What you've never used a phone book? Ok fine, I've never _actually_ used a phone book for anything other than a doorstop either. But, if I had to manually search through antiquated tomes I would use interpolation search. It's the ideal search algorithm / data structure for searching large arrays repeatedly. And with a little bit of operator-strength reducing math sorcery, its not just theoretically fast, its useful in real life!

We spend a lot of time with our keyboards. How do they work? How does pushing dozens of keys on a board transmute into text, code, and commands that control computers?
 
 I have been building a keyboard from scratch, and I'll talk about the different pieces: from the circuit that connects the key switches to the firmware that reads them and presents everything in USB. I'll also have some tips if you want to make your own keyboard, Emacs foot pedals, or other Human Interface Devices.

**_"How Merkle trees enable the decentralized Web!"_**

Decentralized networks operate without relying on a central source of truth, and instead rely on group coordination in order to establish a shared state. Trust is distributed among participants, so in order to have confidence that each participant is telling the truth, there must be a mechanism for guaranteeing that participants have not corrupted or tampered with the system's state.
 
 Enter the Merkle tree, a data structure that was patented in 1979, and because of its unique content validating and performance qualities, has since become the backbone of decentralized software like Git, BitTorrent, ZFS, and Ethereum.

**_"A punch card ate my program!"_**

COBOL is the Rodney Dangerfield of programming languages — it doesn't get any respect. COBOL is routinely denigrated for its verbosity and dismissed as archaic, and for good reason: COBOL bears little to no resemblance to modern programming languages. Yet COBOL is far from a dead language. It processes an estimated 85% of all business transactions, and 5 billion lines of new COBOL code are written every year!
 
 In the past I've argued that COBOL isn't such a bad language, but I'm not going to do that here! Instead, we'll journey deep into the past to recreate a retro bug that could only happen in COBOL! Our travels will include:
 
 * syntactic white space!
 * scotch tape!
 * dueling compiler options!
 * virtual punch cards!
 * sentences!
 * code blocks!
 * periods!
 
 No punch cards were harmed in the creation of this talk.

**Walt Mankowski** is a recovering ivory tower computer scientist who recently completed a postdoc working with biologists to process and visualize terabytes of 2D and 3D time lapse microscope images. In his past life he spent 10 years as a COBOL programmer at a major cable home shopping network. He enjoys Perl, regular expressions, high-performance computing, and Futurama.

**_"Islamic Geometry: Hankin’s Polygons in Contact Algorithm!!!"_**

In this talk we will go over Hankin’s “Polygons in Contact” algorithm, a technique for generating common patterns encountered in Islamic geometry, and some variations on it. There will be an introduction to tiling theory, quite a few pretty pictures, and two (!!) interactive examples in JS.

We’ll also briefly touch on the historical and cultural aspects of this kind of geometry!
