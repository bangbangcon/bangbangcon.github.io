### Bruce Waggoner - Saving Voyager 1!

Both of the 47 year old Voyager spacecraft are currently in interstellar space and returning their most important data set; in-situ measurements of the magnetic field, plasma and dust beyond the Heliopause.   In late 2023, Voyager 1 lost all downlink telemetry and the flight team had essentially no visibility into the state of the spacecraft which is over 15 billion miles from the Earth.   This talk will detail how the flight team diagnosed the problem, and formulated a recovery plan to patch the Flight Data System flight software.

I am the Mission Assurance Manager at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab/Caltech. I graduated from the University of Nebraska with a BS in Physics and Astronomy.  I have worked at JPL for 39 years supporting dozens of Earth orbiting and deep space missions.  I also volunteer as a gymnastics coach and assist teaching girls engineering and science at a local high school.

### Dawn Walker

**Dawn Walker** is a researcher and designer interested in how computing intersects with just transitions. She has started a tech worker co-op, participated in community-led archiving of environmental and climate data, and schemed about mesh networking (to name a few things) in her attempts to create alternatives to existing ways of building and stewarding technology. Since 2017 she has co-organized Our Networks, a conference about the past, present, and future of building our own network infrastructures hosted in Toronto and Vancouver.

**It's alive.... IT'S ALIVE!!! Braitenberg Vehicles! (Have you ever seen an AI like this??!!)**

"AI has been getting more and more complex. Surrounded by chess robots, self-driving cars, and now Large Language Models, we begin to ask ourselves: what does it take for a machine to behave like a human? Does it take millions of parameters? Mountains of training data?

None of the above! Introducing... Braitenberg Vehicles! These are simple, human-like robots that are made only of a couple of sensors and motors. In this talk, I will convince you that these simple components are enough to show human-like behavior, and we will get to see some Braitenberg Vehicles in action using a Braitenberg Vehicles Simulator I made!"

**Devon** is a student at Harvey Mudd College studying computer science and mathematics. Outside of computer science, they also like to write musical theater!

**Making Chinese Typefaces! with Components!!??!!**

Are you stuck finding a great chinese typeface for you to use? Scared to find something that might get twitter in a fight over? This talk will teach you the basics of Chinese type systems, how to use them, and why computing and component based architecture can dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for you to make an 8,000 character font.

**Ivan Zhao** (he/him) is a poet, game & type designer, and web artist interested in nonlinear narratives, forms, and mechanics that reckon with digital, diasporic, and queer identity. His work interrogates individual and viewer agency.

**Backtraces in the Mirror: Stealing the Secrets of Elves and Dwarves to Perform Mad Science!!**

While writing an unobtrusive memory profiler, I discovered I needed to reconstruct a running program's stack the wrong way around! I thought this was impossible, and it turns out I was wrong! So join me to learn about how stack unwinding works (and when it doesn't!), how to use ELF and DWARF information all wrong(!), working with uncertain information (and why!), and the value of doing things that "can't possibly work"!!

**Julian Squires** is a lifelong programmer and eccentric layabout. He previously spoke at !!Con 2017 about "the Emoji that Killed Chrome" (!!).

**Programming with only exceptions!**

We're used to programming with a lot of control flow constructs, but some languages (ðŸ‘€ Python...) use exceptions for control flow. What if that was *all* we had? Nicole made the poor decision to find out, and created Hurl! She will discuss what programming looks like when we eschew normal control flow, how to implement normal-feeling control flow, and some of the limitations of the existing Hurl implementation.

**Nicole** is a Principal Software Engineer at Remesh, where she focuses on software architecture, performance, scalability, and security. Outside of work, she plays with her kids, spends too much time on computers, hangs out at the Recurse Center, and drinks tons of decaf coffee.

**SATisfying Answers to Difficult Questions!**

SAT solvers have been used to find solutions to a wide variety of problems in domains such as code generation, formal verification, and scheduling. But what even are they, and how do they work?? In this talk I'll provide a brief overview of what a SAT solver is and some different approaches they use to solve problems! I hope to demystify these very useful tools and give you some insight into why and when you might want to use them.

**Vaibhav** used to write web applications for a living. He still does, but he used to, too. When he's not doing that you can find him at the gym making sure the weight trees have equal numbers of plates on them or engaging in some ill-advised revenge bedtime procrastination.
