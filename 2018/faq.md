# Frequently asked questions about !!Con

## Can I fork !!Con?

**TL;DR: Go for it, but please call your conference something else.**

From time to time, people ask us if it's okay with us if they organize
their own !!Con-like conference.  We're thrilled that you like the
idea of !!Con enough to want to organize your own !!Con-like event,
and we're **totally okay** with that, with the following caveats:

  * don't call your conference "!!Con" (or use our logo or other branding), and
  * don't claim any official affiliation with !!Con.

(We first stated this policy
[in July 2014](https://twitter.com/bangbangcon/status/492523960542568448).)

It is, of course, perfectly fine (but not required) to say that your
event was inspired by !!Con.  Two recent examples of similarly-themed
conferences are
[EnthusiastiCon](https://sourcecode.berlin/enthusiasticon/), held in
Berlin in June 2015, and [Curly Braces](http://curlybraces.rocks), to
be held in Atlanta in November 2015.

## What advice do you have for people who want to run their own !!Con-like event?

!!Con is a conference of ten-minute talks about the joy, excitement,
and surprise of programming, but there are also a lot of other things
that we do that make !!Con what it is: anonymized talk proposals,
real-time captioning, pay-what-you-want admission, no Q&A, and so on.
You are, of course, not obligated to do any of these things at your own
conference, but we think they make !!Con better, and we hope that you
consider them!
