# Code of Conduct

Below, you’ll find the Code of Conduct for Exclamation Foundation events --
for now, these are !!Con and !!Con West.  But before we start into it, we’d
like to first answer the question: **why have a code of conduct at all?**  Not
only because we feel like we’re expected to have one; not because someone
told us to; not because we heard somewhere that it was important for some
reason – but **as part of an intentional effort to define the culture of !!Con
events**.  We don’t think that !!Con is something that you passively
participate in: everyone who attends **helps construct !!Con** and, ideally,
makes it better.  The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to give our
attendees -- that’s you! -- some ideas that help bring all of us closer to
that ideal of a better conference.

But what do we mean by "better"?

One of our goals with !!Con is to bring communities together for conferences
about the excitement, joy, and surprise of computing.  But we can’t do that
unless we reflect the breadth of humanity in our communities: without
building a space where that humanity can flourish, without making that space
**equitably** accessible for many different people, or without the space having
**representation** from the many stories that make us all up, everyone misses
out on the **people** that make computing exciting, joyful, and surprising. 
More concretely, we think that the privilege of feeling welcome at a
conference is something that just as well ought to belong to groups that
have been traditionally marginalized in our community, and we want to make
our conferences someplace where that’s possible.  This Code of Conduct is
our way of engaging you in the process of imagining how we can build the
community that we all want to compute in.

## Things to think about

There are some obvious things that everybody should do (or not do, as the
case may be!).  By now, it should be clear to you that **harassment has no
place at !!Con**.  There are almost limitless ways to harass people; an
incomplete list might include harassment based on gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, skin color, or
religion.  Don’t do any of those things, and in any event, please be mindful
of how you talk to and about other people at the conference.  You should
assume that everyone else at the conference has a technical background, no
matter whether people like them are or aren’t well-represented in computing. 
“Jokes” (or serious actions, for that matter) that serve to exclude people
obviously aren’t okay, either.

Conversely, try to make an extra effort to **be kind and empathetic in how you
act**.  It can be tempting to ask somebody about their background, based on
something about them that you can see or hear.  Remember that !!Con
attendees are first and foremost at the conference to talk about the joy,
excitement, and surprise of computing.  Inevitably, the stories that make up
the people become a part of that, but on the other hand, it might be kinder
to focus first on the computing element, and let marginalized folks choose
how much they want to share about themselves.

Our friends at the [Recurse Center in New York](https://www.recurse.com/)
have a small set of [social
rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) that they’ve
come up with; we (the !!Con organizers) felt like their social rules
contributed enormously to a supportive, productive, and fun learning
environment.  These rules are intended to be lightweight, and to make more
explicit certain social norms that are normally implicit.  Most of our
social rules really boil down to “don’t be a jerk” or “don’t be annoying”. 
Of course, almost nobody sets out to be a jerk or annoying, so telling
people not to be jerks isn’t a very productive strategy!

Recurse Center summarizes their rules in four short statements: **“no feigning
surprise”, “no well-actuallys”, “no backseat driving”, and “no subtle
-isms”**.  If you haven’t heard of those before, we encourage you to [read the
rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules); they’re a great
way to add an extra dose of empathy to your time at !!Con (and maybe even
beyond!).

## How we'll resolve disputes

A kind way of interacting with your fellow attendees is to **respect their
boundaries**.  If somebody asks you to stop doing something, or tells you that
you’re doing something that makes them uncomfortable, **just stop doing it**. 
Even if you think that what you’re doing is reasonable, it’s better to be
cautious and respectful.  It’s often inappropriate to ask someone who makes
such a request of you to explain themselves, but if you’d like some clarity,
we’re always happy to help -- come talk to an event organizer, and we’ll be
happy to explain how we see the situation!

In general, we’d like to resolve disputes in a collaborative fashion.  Most
of the time, we’ve found that there’s something to learn, and ways that the
whole community can grow in response!  (We’ve written about some of these in
[our past transparency reports](#transparency-reports).)  But, while we hope it doesn’t
happen, we want to be sensitive to the fact that the experience of being
harassed is already scary and unpleasant enough, and we don’t want to make
it worse through how we handle reports.

So, if someone is behaving (either towards you, or towards someone else) in
a way that you don’t think is appropriate for !!Con, or that makes you feel
uncomfortable, you have a few options available to you.  You can try to
resolve it on your own, and if that works out, we’d like to hear about it as
a success story!  But **we want you to know that we have your back, and so we
encourage you to get an event organizer involved if you’d like some help**. 
You can tell us anonymously, if you like, or you can attach your contact
information, so we can follow up (more about how to do that at [the bottom
of this document](#getting-in-touch)).  Either way, our policy is that we do not tell the
subject of a Code of Conduct concern who brought the matter to our
attention.

We hope it doesn’t come to this, but at our discretion, **we will ask
attendees who harm the !!Con community to leave**.  This Code of Conduct is a
guide, and since we can’t possibly write down all the ways you can hurt
people, we may ask attendees to leave for reasons that we didn’t write down
explicitly here.  On the other hand, where it’s appropriate, we want to be
forgiving, too: if it seems like you’ve made a good-natured mistake, we want
to give you space to grow and learn!

This Code of Conduct applies not just in “official” !!Con-sponsored spaces,
but also in spaces adjacent to the conference.  If you have a concern about
something that happens outside of the !!Con conference room, we want you to
feel comfortable bringing it to the organizers.  And, although we explicitly
called out attendees above, this Code of Conduct applies to everybody who
contributes to the !!Con space, including attendees, organizers, sponsors,
volunteers, staff, and Exclamation Foundation board members.

## Guidelines for speakers

If you’re a speaker -- thank you!  We’ve been really lucky to have speakers
who give thoughtful and exciting talks that are almost always inclusive of
the people in the !!Con audience.

Here are a few guidelines you can use to help make your talk even more
welcoming to everyone in the !!Con community:

* **Give people a heads up if you're discussing sensitive topics.**  If your
  talk includes descriptions of hurtful experiences that attendees might
  share, let us know about it!  Some of these include transphobic,
  homophobic, sexually-motivated, racially-motivated, or
  religiously-motivated abuse and harassment; sexual assault; eating
  disorders; mental illness and self-harm; or relationship abuse.  It's not
  possible to give a full list, but these are some examples of things that
  we hope you'll be sensitive of.  If you expect to cover these topics, **talk
  to the !!Con organizers before the conference** so that we can let attendees
  know these topics will be covered in your talk.  If you want to discuss a
  sensitive topic in your talk and you'd like help approaching it, let us
  know and we'll be happy to brainstorm with you.

* **Avoid unnecessarily violent and sexual imagery.**  Sometimes, including
  these is unavoidable, or is central to the point of the talk, and that's
  okay.  But sometimes, the imagery isn't necessary.  This can be in overt
  ways (for example sexual images) or in more subtle ways (like an indirect
  sexual reference used as a joke).  So before your talk, take one more look
  over your slides and prep material in this light -- and if you explicitly
  plan to include sexual or violent content, consider how you can
  contextualize it.  (If you plan to include
  *graphically* violent content, please do let us know in advance.)

* **Talk to the experts.**  !!Con thrives at the intersection of computers
  and the human experience.  Many of us have become experts in technologies
  just by reading about them, but this doesn't always work when real people
  become involved!  If you plan to include anecdotes about the experiences
  of a minority group you're not a member of in your talk, make sure you've
  spoken with someone from that group first.  They can help guide you on
  what language would accurately capture their experience, and how to do it
  with sensitivity.

Often, talks won't need to make any changes at all to address these!  But
even if your talk is mostly about computers, taking 10 minutes to go through
it and look for some of these issues (even if they're subtle!) goes a long
way to keeping !!Con welcoming for everyone.

## Getting in touch

the Recurse Center social rules, please feel free to reach out to the
conference organizers, or to the [Exclamation Foundation
board](mailto:board@exclamation.foundation).

If you notice behavior that feels out-of-place at !!Con -- you’re being
harassed, you see someone else being harassed, or something just makes you
uncomfortable -- please contact a member of conference staff.  Even if you
don’t think that disciplinary action is needed, we want to keep tabs on how
we can build a better conference, so please feel free to reach out to us.
