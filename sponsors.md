been called "radically inclusive" by past speakers and attendees. We
need your help to keep !!Con open and available to all!

#### A note about employee tickets

Space at !!Con is limited, so we humbly request that these tickets go
to employees of your company who will really enjoy the subject matter
of the talks.  What that means will depend on the company, but it's
likely to mean programmer/engineer employees or programming
enthusiasts.

## Sponsor a conference element!

Attendees really remember the names of sponsors of the unique elements of
!!Con, so these are a great way to stand out!  If these interest you,
[get in touch](mailto:julia@jvns.ca) and we can talk
about including them in your sponsorship package.

* **Live streaming and recording.** All of !!Con's talks are broadcast
  in real time to viewers around the world; we've even heard of groups
  organizing "!!Con watch parties"!  We also record and upload all of
  !!Con's talks for anyone to watch on YouTube.  Having your
  organization's name associated with streaming and video-on-demand is the
  sponsorship gift that keeps on giving!

* **Live captioning.** !!Con aims to be a radically inclusive
  conference, and one of the most visible ways that we act on that is by
  hiring a captioner to transcribe each speaker in realtime.  Our experience
  is that captioning is useful not just to audience members with
  disabilities, but to everyone, giving people more options to engage with
  our amazing speakers.  If accessibility is important to your organization,
  a great way to demonstrate that is by having your name displayed right
  alongside the caption feed all day long, and we'd love to offer that to
  you!

* **Sponsor a meal.** Lunch and snack breaks have been some of the most
  exciting parts of !!Cons, when attendees come together and "unconference"
  -- not to mention getting the joy of getting to fill your stomach after a
  morning of invigorating talks!  Our experience at conferences is that
  everybody remembers who fed them, and sponsor-associated food has been a
  big hit in the past. 

If you have other ideas, we'd love to hear about them and work with you -- feel
free to [contact us](mailto:julia@jvns.ca)!
