# Sponsoring !!Con

Thank you for your interest in sponsoring !!Con 2022!  ðŸ’œ We're an online
event this year, but we still have bills to pay -- we're committed to
compensating our speakers for the hard work that they put in on creating
amazing talks, and our famous accessibility (including real-time captioning)
costs money, too.

We are committed to keeping !!Con a pay-what-you-want event, and have
been called "radically inclusive" by past speakers and attendees. We
need your help to keep !!Con open and available to all!  In exchange, we'd
love to help put your company in front of our hundreds of smart, creative,
thoughtful participants.

Below are some sponsorship tiers that we've put together as starting points,
but we're happy to customize a package to meet the needs of your
organization!  If you're interested in sponsoring, or if you have any
questions, please [send us some
mail](mailto:2022-organizers@exclamation.foundation).

#### A note about employee tickets

Space at !!Con is limited, so we humbly request that these tickets go
to employees of your company who will really enjoy the subject matter
of the talks.  What that means will depend on the company, but it's
likely to mean programmer/engineer employees or programming
enthusiasts.

## Sponsor a conference element!

Attendees really remember the names of sponsors of the elements that makes
!!Con special, so these are a great way to stand out!  If these interest you,
[get in touch](mailto:2022-organizers@exclamation.foundation) and we can talk
about including them in your sponsorship package.

* **Live streaming and recording.** All of !!Con's talks are broadcast
  in real time to viewers around the world; we've even heard of groups
  organizing "!!Con watch parties"!  We also record and upload all of
  !!Con's talks for anyone to watch on YouTube.  Having your
  organization's name associated with streaming and video-on-demand is the
  sponsorship gift that keeps on giving!

* **Live captioning.** !!Con aims to be a radically inclusive
  conference, and one of the most visible ways that we act on that is by
  hiring a captioner to transcribe each speaker in realtime.  Our experience
  is that captioning is useful not just to audience members with
  disabilities, but to everyone, giving people more options to engage with
  our amazing speakers.  If accessibility is important to your organization,
  a great way to demonstrate that is by having your name displayed right
  alongside the caption feed all day long, and we'd love to offer that to
  you!

If you have other ideas, we'd love to hear about them and work with you -- feel
free to [contact us](mailto:2022-organizers@exclamation.foundation)!
