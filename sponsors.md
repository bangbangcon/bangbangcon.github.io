### *A note about employee tickets

Space at !!Con is limited, so we humbly request that these tickets go
to employees of your company who will really enjoy the subject matter
of the talks.  What that means will depend on the company, but it's
likely to mean programmer/engineer employees or programming
enthusiasts.
