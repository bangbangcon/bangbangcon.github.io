		  <p><strong><em>Help! Help!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>This catalog of Perl introspection techniques will amaze,
		  confound, or disgust you!  A Perl method call like
		  <code>$object->fgsfds()</code> emits an unhelpful message
		  about an unknown method, without any advice about what
		  <em>would</em> have worked.</p>

		  <p>We will see the internals of <code>Help.pm</code>, a Perl
		  module which catches an attempt to call an undefined method,
		  and emits a helpful list of valid method names.</p>

		  <p>First, we will see how the <code>Help</code> module
		  forcibly inserts itself into the inheritance hierarchy for
		  the target module, so that failed method lookups will be
		  dispatched to <code>Help</code> when normal inheritance
		  fails. Then we will see Perl's <code>AUTOLOAD</code>
		  feature, the method of last
		  resort. The <code>AUTOLOAD</code> method
		  in <code>Help</code> will then search the inheritance
		  hierarchy synthetically, using Perl's symbol table
		  interface, to locate methods of interest. Finally, the
		  <code>AUTOLOAD</code> method will emit a report about what
		  was found.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Making music with floppy drives! An exercise
		  in yak shaving</em></strong></p>

		  <p>When I started developing Flopkestra, a floppy drive
		  orchestra, I quickly stumbled upon the difficulty of
		  manually encoding music into the custom bytecode that my
		  orchestra could understand. That's when I had the idea of
		  writing a program that could automatically extract melodies
		  from recordings!</p>

		  <p>In this talk, I will describe my (ongoing) quest to get
		  from whistling a tune into my laptop microphone to hearing
		  the melody bursting out of floppy drives.</p>

		  <p>What began as an idea to produce some noise out of
		  objects found in the dumpster lead me down the twisty path
		  of hardware hacking, MIDI file parsing, digital signal
		  processing and HTML5 canvas programming, none of which I
		  knew anything about before starting this project.</p>

		  <p>While yak shaving is generally considered to be the enemy
		  of "getting stuff done", I realized that it is a really good
		  way of learning new things and keeping alive the excitement
		  of programming! If you find yourselves out of ideas for
		  satisfying your tinkering urges, it is my hope that you
		  might be inspired by my experience.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Weaving and Programming: More Related Than
		  You (Probably) Realize!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>Weaving (one of the most popular methods of turning
		  string into fabric) and programming may seem like they have
		  little to do with each other, but the history of weaving
		  technology and the history of computing are actually closely
		  related. I love weaving <em>and</em> programming, and
		  discovering that weaving technology is part of what made
		  computers possible made me ridiculously happy.</p>

		  <p>This talk will walk through a brief explanation of how
		  weaving works and how weaving tools developed over time, so
		  that the connection between weaving and early computing
		  makes sense (and because weaving is cool in itself, and has
		  some interesting parallels to programming). Then I'll
		  discuss how looms helped create early computers, and how

		  <p><strong><em>The terrible Yook monster! Slayed by the
		  grandson of Master Prolog!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>I held my sword in front, and approached the village
		  cautiously. I would have to slaughter the terrible Yook
		  monster disguised in one of the hapless villagers' homes. I
		  pushed the doors open, ready to hack and slash. To my shock,
		  all of the villagers looked exactly the same!</p>

		  <p>And each had something to say about the other Anouki:</p>

		  <ul>
			<li>FoFo said that Gumo was honest.</li>
			<li>Kumu said Mazo or Aroo was lying.</li>
			<li>Dobo said Mazo was honest.</li>
			<li>Gumo said Fofo or Aroo was lying.</li>
			<li>Aroo said Kumu was lying.</li>
			<li>Mazo said that he and Dobo were honest.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>How dastardly! Only the Yook would lie to me. And I
          couldn't just kill them all and let God sort them out. I had
          to think about this. So I did what anyone in this
          circumstance would do: I pulled out Alloy.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>How I used my knowledge of code (and music!)
		  to help fight fires!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>Rural areas often require emergency responders to carry
		  "pagers" with them to be informed about fires and other
		  emergencies. These pagers are actually specialized radios,
		  each specially configured to respond to one type of message
		  intended for the individual carrying it.</p>

		  <p>Aside from requiring users to carry an extra device, this
		  system has many drawbacks, including range and battery life
		  limitations. Recently I worked with a company that has been
		  building a system to bridge the gap between this old
		  broadcast system and mobile devices. I helped to improve the
		  reliability and ease of configuration of their systems by
		  rewriting the code which is responsible for recording the
		  radio broadcasts and decoding the signals which are used to
		  identify the intended recipients of the messages.</p>

		  <p>I will discuss how the system works and also do a quick
		  demo. The demo is a lot of fun in no small part because it
		  involves various hardware, including a small Linux box, a
		  radio, and funny tones and recorded sounds.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Now you're thinking with PCMPISTRI!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>I needed a custom string comparison routine, and the C
		  version wasn't fast enough. It turns out that modern Intel
		  processors have SIMD instructions that understand C-style
		  strings. So I considered writing a faster version in
		  assembly language. I actually ended up solving the problem a
		  different way, but I decided to write the SIMD assembly
		  version anyway. This sort of programming is tremendously
		  fun, because you have these weird instructions and you have

		  <p>Hindley-Milner (H-M) type inference is an algorithm which
		  deduces static types in programming languages like OCaml and
		  Haskell, where the programmer does not have to explicitly
		  declare types. Its performance is usually described as
		  either "fast enough" or "worst case exponential" depending
		  on who you ask, and whether they're being formal about it or
		  trying to sell you on one of these languages.</p>

		  <p>It turns out that H-M actually <em>is</em> exponential in
		  time and space in the worst case. There's a really tiny
		  program that demonstrates this. It's only around 100
		  characters long, but the type that H-M infers is thousands
		  of characters long! The existence of this edge case is
		  fascinating, even though in practice H-M is fast enough for

		  <p><strong><em>Proofs about programs, proofs as programs,
		  and programs as proofs!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>Say you had two pieces of code that looked different, but

		  <code>if</code> statements and you're a compiler who wants
		  to optimize code by exchanging one for the other. How would
		  you prove that they were equal? And since you're already a
		  compiler, why don't we verify your proof with a
		  computer?!</p>

		  <p>We'll take a tour through the world of interactive
		  theorem proving with <a href="http://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a>,
		  a proof assistant. We'll use Coq to interactively prove that
		  two pieces of code, though they look different, are "equal"
		  in that they return the same values for all inputs. Our
		  proof will lead us to examine the strange correspondence
		  between proofs and programs. It's an exciting development at
