		  <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/skamille">Camille Fournier</a></strong>
		  has been nerding up all the things since
		  Amigas were cool and having access to Gopher was the
		  hotness. She proudly writes most of her code in Java, burned
		  out on functional programming in the 90s, and still really
		  doesn't get CSS. Her hobbies include weightlifting, vintage
		  fashion, tweeting, and helping keep 100% volunteer open
		  source projects from falling into disrepair. She also runs
		  the engineering team at Rent the Runway.</p>

		  <p>Different computational approaches deeply shape how we
			solve problems. Too often people treat their technological
			choices like religions, willfully blinding themselves to
			better solutions for the task at hand. Diversifying your
			computational mindset puts technology back in its rightful
			subservient place: a set of modular, limited tools for
			augmenting unlimited human thought.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Nantucket! Detecting accidental
		  verse</em></strong></p>

		  <p>We wrote programs to find text that matches verse forms
		  like sonnets and limericks. We'll explain how, and subject
		  you to some of the output.</p>

		  <p>When <strong><a href="http://www.daniellesucher.com">Danielle
		  Sucher</a></strong> was a kid, she wanted to grow up to live
		  in a library in a lighthouse and spend all her time learning
		  and solving puzzles and making stuff. Except for the
		  lighthouse (so far), that's pretty much what her grown-up
		  life has become.</p>

		  <p>Wikipedia
		  called <strong><a href="http://wry.me/blog">Darius
		  Bacon</a></strong> a poet, which he thinks is hilarious. He
		  writes toy programs pretty often, and not so many serious
		  ones. He will be in New York for the rest of May.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Help! Help!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>This catalog of Perl introspection techniques will amaze,
		  confound, or disgust you!  A Perl method call like
		  <code>$object->fgsfds()</code> emits an unhelpful message
		  about an unknown method, without any advice about what
		  <em>would</em> have worked.</p>

		  <p>We will see the internals of <code>Help.pm</code>, a Perl
		  module which catches an attempt to call an undefined method,
		  and emits a helpful list of valid method names.</p>

		  <p>First, we will see how the <code>Help</code> module
		  forcibly inserts itself into the inheritance hierarchy for
		  the target module, so that failed method lookups will be
		  dispatched to <code>Help</code> when normal inheritance
		  fails. Then we will see Perl's <code>AUTOLOAD</code>
		  feature, the method of last
		  resort. The <code>AUTOLOAD</code> method
		  in <code>Help</code> will then search the inheritance
		  hierarchy synthetically, using Perl's symbol table
		  interface, to locate methods of interest. Finally, the
		  <code>AUTOLOAD</code> method will emit a report about what
		  was found.</p>

		  <p><strong>Mark</strong> first became interested in
		  programming in the mid-1970s from watching his mom do it. He
		  likes sending network packets because they make amazing
		  things happen in faraway places.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Making music with floppy drives! An exercise
		  in yak shaving</em></strong></p>

		  <p>When I started developing Flopkestra, a floppy drive
		  orchestra, I quickly stumbled upon the difficulty of
		  manually encoding music into the custom bytecode that my
		  orchestra could understand. That's when I had the idea of
		  writing a program that could automatically extract melodies
		  from recordings!</p>

		  <p>In this talk, I will describe my (ongoing) quest to get
		  from whistling a tune into my laptop microphone to hearing
		  the melody bursting out of floppy drives.</p>

		  <p>What began as an idea to produce some noise out of
		  objects found in the dumpster lead me down the twisty path
		  of hardware hacking, MIDI file parsing, digital signal
		  processing and HTML5 canvas programming, none of which I
		  knew anything about before starting this project.</p>

		  <p>While yak shaving is generally considered to be the enemy
		  of "getting stuff done", I realized that it is a really good
		  way of learning new things and keeping alive the excitement
		  of programming! If you find yourselves out of ideas for
		  satisfying your tinkering urges, it is my hope that you
		  might be inspired by my experience.</p>

		  <p><strong><a href="http://www.rafik.ca">Rafik</a></strong>
		  is a tinkerer and (currently sedentary) wanderer living in
		  Toronto. When he is not trying to make music out of
		  dumpstered objects, he is most probably found
		  reading <code>man</code> pages, making culinary experiments
		  or taking long walks into unknown parts of the city.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Spying on your programs with

		  <p>strace lets you look into the soul of a program and see
		  how it works. Without even seeing the source code! ANY
		  program. I've become kind of obsessed with it and I'd like
		  to share my obsession with you. We'll learn about system
		  calls and go through a couple of practical examples of how
		  to use strace to solve your everyday programming
		  problems.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Brainwaves!  On your

		  <p>There's more self to quantify than number of steps taken,
		  especially in our heads! In this talk I will demonstrate
		  building an application with Node.js that uses a
		  consumer-grade EEG (electroencephalography) device to
		  display detected brain activity. It's pretty awesome that we
		  can (start to) analyze our brains from little programs on
		  our laptops!</p>

		  <p><strong><em>The terrible Yook monster! Slayed by the
		  grandson of Master Prolog!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>I held my sword in front, and approached the village
		  cautiously. I would have to slaughter the terrible Yook
		  monster disguised in one of the hapless villagers' homes. I
		  pushed the doors open, ready to hack and slash. To my shock,
		  all of the villagers looked exactly the same!</p>

		  <p>And each had something to say about the other Anouki:</p>

		  <ul>
			<li>FoFo said that Gumo was honest.</li>
			<li>Kumu said Mazo or Aroo was lying.</li>
			<li>Dobo said Mazo was honest.</li>
			<li>Gumo said Fofo or Aroo was lying.</li>
			<li>Aroo said Kumu was lying.</li>
			<li>Mazo said that he and Dobo were honest.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>How dastardly! Only the Yook would lie to me. And I
          couldn't just kill them all and let God sort them out. I had
          to think about this. So I did what anyone in this
          circumstance would do: I pulled out Alloy.</p>

		  <p>Alloy is MIT's Daniel Jackson's ground-breaking new logic
		  programming language which turns the whole notion of logic
		  programming upside down &mdash; nay, turns programming as a
		  whole upside down.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Serial! It's what's for breakfast.</em></strong></p>

		  <p>Me: I want to write a program that talks to a serial
		  port. Reality: What is serial port? How does work?</p>

		  <P>This talk aims to fill in that reality gap. I'll cover
		  the basics of what serial is, how it works (RTS/CTS, stop
		  signals, buffers), and possibly go over how to
		  write/interact with Unix serial ports (in C or walk through
		  part of the python pyserial library. TBD).</p>

		  <p>All serial info to be based on the RS-232 protocol.</p>

		  <h3>David Turner</h3>

		  <p><strong><em>Now you're thinking with PCMPISTRI!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>I needed a custom string comparison routine, and the C
		  version wasn't fast enough. It turns out that modern Intel
		  processors have SIMD instructions that understand C-style
		  strings. So I considered writing a faster version in
		  assembly language. I actually ended up solving the problem a
		  different way, but I decided to write the SIMD assembly
		  version anyway. This sort of programming is tremendously
		  fun, because you have these weird instructions and you have
		  to try to solve your problem under bizarre and arbitrary
		  constraints.</p>

		  <p><strong><a href="http://novalis.org/">David Turner</a></strong> hacks on
		  git at Twitter. He previously co-founded OpenTripPlanner,
		  and worked on version 3 of the GPL. He enjoys contributing
		  patches to random projects, like Inkscape and Linux. He
		  lives on Mars with his glorious wife and three pet
		  tigers.</p>
